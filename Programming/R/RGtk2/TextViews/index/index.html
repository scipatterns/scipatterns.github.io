9.5 Sharing buffers between text entries
As of GTK+ version 2.18, multiple instances of GtkEntry can synchronize
their text through a shared buffer. Each entry obtains its text from the same
underlying model, a GtkEntryBuffer. Here, we construct two entries, with
a shared buffer:
<pre>
buffer <- gtkEntryBuffer ( )
entry1 <- gtkEntry ( buffer = buffer )
entry2 <- gtkEntry ( buffer = buffer )
entry1$setText ( "echo" )
entry2$getText ( )
[1] " echo "
</pre>
The change of text in "entry1" has been reflected in "entry2".

9.6 Text views
Multiline text areas are displayed through GtkTextView instances. These
provide a view of an accompanying GtkTextBuffer, which is the model
that stores the text and other objects to be rendered. The view is responsible
for the display of the text in the buffer and has methods for adjusting
tabs, margins, indenting, etc. The text buffer stores the actual text, and its
methods are for adding and manipulating the text.
<br>
A text view is created with gtkTextView. The underlying text buffer can
be passed to the constructor. Otherwise, a buffer is automatically created.
This buffer is returned by the method getBuffer and can be set with the
setBuffer method. Text views provide native scrolling support and thus
are easily added to a scrolled window (Section 7.4).

Example 9.10: Basic gtkTextView usage
The steps to construct a text view consist of
<pre>
view <- gtkTextView ( )
scrolled_window <- gtkScrolledWindow ( )
scrolled_window$add ( view )
scrolled_window$setPolicy ( "automatic" , "automatic" )
##
window <- gtkWindow ( )
window [ ’border -width’ ] <- 15
window$add ( scrolled_window )
    </pre>
To set all the text in the buffer requires accessing the underlying buffer:
<pre>
buffer <- view$getBuffer ( )
buffer$setText ( "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ..." )
    </pre>
Manipulating the text requires an understanding of how positions are
referred to within the buffer (iterators or marks). As an indicator, to get
the contents of the buffer can be done as follows:
    <pre>
start <- buffer$getStartIter ( ) $iter
end <- buffer$getEndIter ( ) $iter
buffer$getText ( start , end )
[1] " Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ..."
        </pre>
